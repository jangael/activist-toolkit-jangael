    Overall, BIPOCs are less likely to have access or seek out to mental health services.
  They are less likely to receive needed care and more likely to receive poor and inconsistent quality of care. Mental health
    is also looked down upon in many ethnic and cultural communities.

      <ul>
        <li>1 in 5 Black People in the U.S live in Poverty.</li>
        <li>Black people living below poverty are twice as likely to report
        serious psychological distress than those living over 2x the poverty level.</li>
        <li>58.2% of Black young adults, ages 18-25, and 50.1% adults, aged 26-49, don't 
        receive treatment.</li>
        <li>Research indicates that Blacks and African Americans 
          believe that mild depression or anxiety would be considered “crazy” in their social circles. </li>
        <li>Binge drinking, smoking (cigarettes and marijuana), illicit drug use and prescription pain reliever misuse are 
          more frequent among Black and African American adults with mental illnesses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Due to the history of racism, including slavery and exclusion from
        health, social, and economic resources, that many black people faced in 
        the U.S., it led to socioeconomic disparities for the community. Those with low socioeconomic
        status are at higher risk for poor mental health.

      <h2>Barriers the Indigenous Community Face</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Native/Indigenous people experience serious psychological distress 2.5
        times more than the general popukation.</li>
        <li>Use and abuse alcohol and other drugs at younger ages and higher rates than
        all other ethnic groups.</li>
        <li>Overall lack of awareness, programs, and high levels of povery prevents 
        Native/Indigenous people to receive treatment.</li>
        <li>19% reported to having mentall iness in 2018.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The beliefs that Indigenous and Native Americans have and how they express
        their distress is not consistent with standard diagnostic categories. They are more likely to reach out
        more from a spirtual/traditional healer than any other source. There are lack of mental health services in rural, 
        isolated locations where many Native/Indigenous people reside in or outside tribal areas.

      <h2>Barriers the Asian Community Face</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>15% of Asians reported having mental illness in 2018.</li>
        <li>Language barriers and tabooness in Asian cultures led to many
        Asian Americans dismissing, denying, or neglecting their symptoms.</li>
        <li>73.1% of AAPI adults with mental illness do not receive treatment</li>
        <li>Most Asian Americans tend to seek out support from family, friends, and religious
     communities rather than professional help for their concerns.</li>
        <li>Suicidal thoughts and major depressive episodes increased among AAPI young
     adults.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Due to the "<a href="https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/what-is-the-model-minority-myth">
        model minority</a>" microagression, Asians are held up to high expectations
        when it comes to apperance and successes. There is shame and guilt within the community that makes
        it less likely for Asians to reach out. There's also racial discrimination and religious intolerance, especially
        with Muslims and Sikhs, that can play a huge factor for reaching out.

      <h2>Barriers the Latinx/Hispanic Community Face</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>19% of Latinx/Hispanic people in the U.S live in Poverty.</li>
        <li>A perception about discussing mental health in the Latinx/Hispanic
        Community can create shame and embarrassment for the family.</li>
        <li>Overall mental health issues are on the rise for the community: 16% reported having
        mental illness in 2018</li>
        <li>90% of Latinx/Hispanic people over the age of 12 with a substance use disorder
        did not receive treatment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the community, mental health and mental illness is a stigmatized topic due to religious 
        faith and traditins within their families. There is also poor communication between
        health care providers and Latinx/Hispanic patients due to language barriers. Bilingual patients
        are evaluated differently than white patients, which can lead to different diagnosis. There is also
        links of mental distress due to immigration.
