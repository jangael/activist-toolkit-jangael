        <p>
          Change starts with you, no matter how big and small. Whether or not
          you are directly affected by this issue or want to be an ally, its
          important that you take steps to make sure the topic of mental health
          can be normalized and talked about in everyday life. We need to
          diversify the mental health system to make BIPOCs more comfortable
          sharing their experiences and getting proper treatment. Below is going
          to list various organizations and resources to reach out to and find
          more information about mental health issues in the BIPOC community.
